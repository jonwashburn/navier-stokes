theorem lagrange_identity (a b : Fin 3 → ℝ) :
    ‖cross a b‖^2 = ‖a‖^2 * ‖b‖^2 - (inner_prod a b)^2 := by
  -- This is the standard Lagrange identity for the cross product

  -- Since ⟨a,b⟩² ≥ 0, we have ‖a × b‖² ≤ ‖a‖²‖b‖²

  have h_nonneg_right : 0 ≤ ‖a‖ * ‖b‖ := mul_nonneg (norm_nonneg _) (norm_nonneg _)

/-- Cross product is bilinear in first argument - addition -/

  -- This follows from the bilinearity of the cross product operation
  -- The detailed proof requires expanding the cross product definition
  sorry

/-- Cross product is bilinear in first argument - scalar multiplication -/
lemma cross_smul_left (r : ℝ) (a b : Fin 3 → ℝ) :
    cross (r • a) b = r • cross a b := by
  -- This follows from the bilinearity of the cross product operation
  -- The detailed proof requires expanding the cross product definition
  sorry

/-- Dot product of vector with cross product (scalar triple product property) -/
lemma inner_cross_left (a b c : Fin 3 → ℝ) :
    inner_prod a (cross b c) = inner_prod b (cross c a) := by
  rw [inner_prod, inner_prod, cross, cross, triple_product_permutation]

lemma inner_cross_right (a b c : Fin 3 → ℝ) :
    inner_prod (cross a b) c = inner_prod a (cross b c) := by
  rw [inner_prod, inner_prod, cross, cross]
  rw [dotProduct_comm, triple_product_permutation]

/-- Vector is orthogonal to its cross products -/
lemma inner_cross_self_left (a b : Fin 3 → ℝ) :

/-- Helper: For aligned vectors with small angle, the difference is bounded -/
theorem aligned_vectors_close {a b : Fin 3 → ℝ} (ha : a ≠ 0) (hb : b ≠ 0)
    (h_angle : inner_prod a b ≥ ‖a‖ * ‖b‖ * Real.cos (π/6)) :
    ‖b - a‖ ≤ 2 * Real.sin (π/12) * max ‖a‖ ‖b‖ := by
  -- This is a geometric result that follows from the law of cosines
  -- For vectors with small angle, their difference is bounded
  -- The detailed proof involves trigonometric identities
