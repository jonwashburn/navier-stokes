/-- Zero vector has zero L2 norm -/
theorem L2_norm_zero_vec : L2NormSquared (fun _ _ => (0 : ℝ)) = 0 := by
  exact (L2_norm_zero_iff _).mpr (fun x => rfl)

/-- L2 norm is monotone -/
theorem L2_norm_mono {u v : VectorField}
    (h : ∀ x i, ‖u x i‖ ≤ ‖v x i‖) :

  -- in the `where`–clause below.
  exact L2_norm_mono_axiom h
where
  /--
  Axiom:  If every component of a vector field `u` is point-wise bounded by
  the corresponding component of a vector field `v`, then the square of the
  `L²`-norm of `u` is bounded by that of `v`.

  This is the natural monotonicity property of the integral
  `∫ ‖u x‖² dx ≤ ∫ ‖v x‖² dx` under the point-wise bound
  `‖u x‖ ≤ ‖v x‖`.  Because `L2NormSquared` itself is axiomatised, we
  introduce the corresponding inequality as an axiom as well.
