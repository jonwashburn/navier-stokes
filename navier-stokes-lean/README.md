# Navier–Stokes Lean 4 Proof (Recognition-Science approach)

This repository contains a Lean 4 formalization of the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness problem using Recognition Science principles.

## Status

Currently, the proof contains **50 sorries** across 15+ files. The main theorem states:

```lean
theorem navier_stokes_global_regularity :
  ∀ (ν : ℝ) (hν : 0 < ν) (initial_data : VectorField),
  smooth_initial_data initial_data →
  ∃! (u : ℝ → VectorField), 
    is_solution_NSE ν u initial_data ∧ 
    globally_regular u
```

## Building

Run `lake build` to compile the project. The build uses increased heartbeats (400,000) for complex Fourier transform calculations.

## Architecture

The proof is organized in four layers:

1. **Foundation Layer** (`RSFoundation.lean`)
   - Recognition Science constants: φ, C*, K*, τ, eight-beat modulation
   - Ledger-balance axiom and spectral-gap statement

2. **Bridge Layer** (`RSFoundationBridge.lean`)
   - Imports RS constants into Navier-Stokes context
   - Energy-conservation and spectral-gap lemmas

3. **Core Analytic Layer**
   - Biot-Savart kernel formalization
   - Vorticity lemmas and estimates
   - Geometric depletion machinery
   - PDE/harmonic analysis tools

4. **High-Level Layer** (`MainTheorem.lean`)
   - Assembles components into complete global regularity proof
   - Uses direct-bootstrap argument

## Key Constants

- Golden ratio: φ = (1+√5)/2
- Recognition timescale: τ = 7.33×10⁻¹⁵ seconds
- Vorticity bounds: C* = 0.05, K* = 0.025
- Geometric depletion: C_GD = 2sin(π/12) ≈ 0.518
- Eight-beat modulation: 1 + (1/8)sin(16πt/τ)

## CI/CD

The project includes GitHub Actions CI that:
- Builds the project on every push/PR
- Counts and reports remaining sorries
- Caches dependencies for faster builds
