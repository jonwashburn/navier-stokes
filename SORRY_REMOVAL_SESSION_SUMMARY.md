## Key Insights Discovered

1. **Scale emergence**: The dissipation scale r = √ν naturally emerges from geometric depletion theory
2. **Phase coherence**: Eight-beat cycle creates factor 2 improvement through phase-locking
3. **Recognition constants**: C_star = 0.05, cascade_cutoff ≈ 0.146 control the dynamics
4. **Time scale issue**: recognition_tick ≈ 7.33e-15 makes 1/recognition_tick huge, requiring careful bounds

## Remaining Challenges

1. **Measure theory**: Many sorries require proper measure-theoretic foundations
2. **Levi-Civita calculations**: Permutation parity calculations need completion
3. **Vector calculus**: Detailed index manipulations for curl(curl) identity
4. **Numerical bounds**: Some bounds are too tight given the extreme smallness of recognition_tick

## Next Steps

1. Focus on GeometricDepletion.lean (11 sorries) as it has the most
2. Implement proper measure theory foundations for L2 norms
3. Complete Levi-Civita permutation calculations
4. Verify numerical bounds match Recognition Science predictions
