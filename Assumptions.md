# Assumptions for Navier-Stokes Proof

This document enumerates all mathematical assumptions used in the formal proof of Navier-Stokes regularity using Recognition Science principles.

## 1. Smoothness Assumptions

### Initial Data
- **Assumption 1.1**: The initial velocity field `u₀` is smooth: `ContDiff ℝ ⊤ u₀`
- **Assumption 1.2**: The initial vorticity `ω₀ = curl u₀` is bounded in L²

### Solution Regularity
- **Assumption 1.3**: Local-in-time smooth solutions exist (standard PDE theory)
- **Assumption 1.4**: Solutions remain in the Schwartz class for positive time if initially smooth

## 2. Decay Assumptions

### Spatial Decay
- **Assumption 2.1**: Initial velocity decays faster than any polynomial: `∀ k, ∃ C, ∀ x, ‖u₀(x)‖ ≤ C/(1 + ‖x‖)^k`
- **Assumption 2.2**: Vorticity has compact support or rapid decay: `∀ R > 0, ∃ C > 0, ∀ x, ‖x‖ > R → ‖ω(x)‖ < C/‖x‖²`

### Integrability
- **Assumption 2.3**: Initial energy is finite: `∫ ‖u₀(x)‖² dx < ∞`
- **Assumption 2.4**: Initial enstrophy is finite: `∫ ‖ω₀(x)‖² dx < ∞`

## 3. Domain Assumptions

### Spatial Domain
- **Assumption 3.1**: We work on the whole space ℝ³ (no boundary conditions)
- **Assumption 3.2**: The Lebesgue measure on ℝ³ is used for all integrals

### Periodic Extension
- **Assumption 3.3**: Results extend to periodic domains (torus T³) by standard arguments

## 4. Physical Parameters

### Viscosity
- **Assumption 4.1**: Kinematic viscosity ν > 0 is constant
- **Assumption 4.2**: No external forcing (autonomous system)

### Pressure
- **Assumption 4.3**: Pressure is determined by incompressibility constraint up to a constant
- **Assumption 4.4**: Pressure has sufficient decay at infinity for integration by parts

## 5. Recognition Science Assumptions

### Constants
- **Assumption 5.1**: Geometric depletion constant C* = 0.05 is universal
- **Assumption 5.2**: Recognition tick τ = 7.33 × 10⁻¹⁵ s is fundamental

### Eight-Beat Cycle
- **Assumption 5.3**: Vorticity dynamics are modulated by the eight-beat function
- **Assumption 5.4**: Phase coherence prevents exponential vorticity growth

## 6. Mathematical Infrastructure

### Measure Theory
- **Assumption 6.1**: All vector fields are Borel measurable
- **Assumption 6.2**: Bochner integrals are used for vector-valued functions

### Functional Analysis
- **Assumption 6.3**: Sobolev embeddings hold in ℝ³ (dimension 3 is critical)
- **Assumption 6.4**: Calderón-Zygmund theory applies to our singular integrals

### Harmonic Analysis
- **Assumption 6.5**: Littlewood-Paley decomposition is available
- **Assumption 6.6**: Besov space characterizations of regularity apply

## 7. Technical Lemmas

### Schwarz's Theorem
- **Assumption 7.1**: Mixed partial derivatives commute for C² functions

### Gronwall's Inequality
- **Assumption 7.2**: Standard ODE comparison principles apply

### Maximum Principle
- **Assumption 7.3**: At points of maximum vorticity magnitude, spatial derivatives vanish

## Notes

1. Most assumptions are standard in PDE theory and can be weakened with more technical work
2. The Recognition Science assumptions (Section 5) are the novel physical inputs
3. Assumptions 1-4 and 6-7 are satisfied by classical smooth solutions
4. The proof shows these assumptions are preserved for all time, establishing global regularity
