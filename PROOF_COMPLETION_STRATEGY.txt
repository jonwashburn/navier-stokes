# Proof Completion Strategy

Current: 55 sorries, 0 axioms
Target: 0 sorries, 0 axioms

## Priority Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 sorries)
- PDEOperators.lean: Implement Schwarz's theorem for mixed partials

### Phase 2: Geometry (5 sorries)  
- CrossBounds.lean: Prove cross_product_bound using Lagrange identity

### Phase 3: Core Theory (11 sorries)
- GeometricDepletion.lean: Depends on CrossBounds, needs spherical integration

### Phase 4: Bridge Files (13 sorries)
- RSClassicalBridge.lean (6): Fix syntax, prove Grönwall lemmas
- DirectBridge.lean (3): Complete ODE analysis  
- RecognitionLemmas.lean (4): Standard inequalities

### Phase 5: Main Results (18 sorries)
- MainTheorem.lean (6): Reference proven lemmas
- VorticityLemmas.lean (6): Sobolev embeddings
- BiotSavart.lean (4): Measure theory
- RSTheorems.lean (3): Recognition constants

### Phase 6: Cleanup (5 sorries)
- Remaining files with 1-2 sorries each

## Key Dependencies
- GeometricDepletion needs CrossBounds
- MainTheorem needs all subordinate results
- Most files need proper L² integration framework

## Next Actions
1. Implement Schwarz's theorem helper
2. Complete cross_product_bound proof
3. Fix lakefile.lean to enable building
