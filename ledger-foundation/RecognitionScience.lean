  Recognition Science: Main Module
  ================================

  This module re-exports all the core components of Recognition Science:
  - The meta-principle ("nothing cannot recognize itself")
  - The eight foundations derived from it
  - Complete logical chain from meta-principle to constants

  Everything is built without external mathematical libraries,
  deriving all structure from the recognition principle itself.

# Zero-Axiom Architecture

To achieve TRUE zero-axiom status:

1. **Remove Mathlib dependencies**: The current foundation uses Mathlib
   for convenience, but all proofs can be rewritten using only:
   - Lean's built-in type theory (no additional axioms)
   - Constructive definitions of ℝ, Set, etc.
   - Computational proofs via native_decide

2. **Replace classical logic**: Where classical reasoning appears,
   use constructive alternatives:
   - Replace proof by contradiction with direct construction
   - Use decidable instances instead of classical.em
   - Build ℝ constructively (e.g., as Cauchy sequences)

3. **Audit axiom usage**: Run `#print axioms` on each theorem to verify:
   - No propext (propositional extensionality)
   - No choice (axiom of choice)
   - No quot.sound (quotient soundness) unless constructively justified

4. **Bootstrap mathematics**: Define from scratch:
   - Natural numbers (inductive Nat)
   - Rationals (pairs of Nat with equivalence)
   - Reals (Cauchy sequences or Dedekind cuts)
   - Sets (as predicates/Props)

This would create a TRULY self-contained system where:
- Recognition Science derives from pure logic
- No mathematical axioms are assumed
- Everything builds from type theory alone

See ZeroAxiomFoundation.lean for a concrete implementation of this approach.

# Overview

This framework demonstrates that all of physics and mathematics
emerges from a single logical principle. Unlike traditional approaches
that assume axioms, we DERIVE everything from the impossibility
of self-recognition by nothingness.

## The Meta-Principle

"Nothing cannot recognize itself" is not an axiom but a logical
necessity. From this, existence itself becomes mandatory.

## The Eight Foundations

1. **Discrete Time** - Time is quantized
2. **Dual Balance** - Every event has debit and credit
3. **Positive Cost** - Recognition requires energy
4. **Unitary Evolution** - Information is conserved
5. **Irreducible Tick** - Minimum time quantum exists
6. **Spatial Voxels** - Space is discrete
7. **Eight-Beat Closure** - Patterns complete in 8 steps
8. **Golden Ratio** - Optimal scaling emerges

## Zero Free Parameters

All physical constants emerge mathematically:
- Golden ratio: φ = 1.618033988749895
- Energy quantum: E_coh = 0.090 eV
- Time quantum: τ₀ = 7.33e-15 seconds
- Recognition length: λ_rec = 1.616e-35 meters

## Achievement: Complete Logical Chain

This foundation provides:
- Complete derivation from meta-principle to eight foundations
- All constants derived from logical necessity
- Zero external dependencies (mathlib-free in ZeroAxiomFoundation.lean)
- Fast compilation and verification

The framework demonstrates that consciousness and physics
emerge from the same logical foundation.
