# Navier-Stokes Proof Progress Summary

## Current Status (June 17, 2025)

### Build Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL

### Progress Metrics
- **Total sorries remaining**: 257
- **Build status**: Passing
- **Zero axioms**: All axioms removed as requested

### Key Achievements
1. **Autonomous Proof System**: Created multiple Python scripts for automated proof completion
   - `setup_autonomous_proof.py` - Original system using Claude 4
   - `enhanced_navier_solver.py` - Batch processing (25 proofs)
   - `turbo_solver.py` - Large batch processing (50 proofs)
   - `progressive_solver.py` - Tracks attempted proofs
   - `systematic_prover.py` - Pattern-based proof generation
   - `targeted_solver.py` - File-specific targeting
   - `claude4_direct_solver.py` - Direct Claude 4 integration
   - `improved_direct_solver.py` - Better pattern matching

2. **Claude 4 Integration**: Successfully integrated Claude 4 Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
   - Initial test: 10/10 proofs successful on UnconditionalProof.lean
   - Demonstrated capability to generate valid Lean 4 proofs

3. **Proof Infrastructure**: 
   - Comprehensive backup system with timestamps
   - Proof verification before application
   - JSON-based proof tracking
   - Parallel processing capabilities

### Files with Most Sorries
1. `Convergence.lean`: 31 sorries
2. `Basic.lean`: 22 sorries  
3. `BealeKatoMajda.lean`: 2 sorries (known difficult)
4. Various files with 1-5 sorries each

### Known Difficult Proofs
- `beale_kato_majda` - Requires deep PDE theory
- `biot_savart_solution` - Complex fluid dynamics
- `C_star_paper_value` - Requires precise π computation
- `K_paper_value` - Requires precise π computation

### Key Constants (from paper)
- C₀ = 0.02 (geometric depletion)
- C* = 0.142 (universal constant)
- K* = 0.090 (bootstrap constant)  
- β = 0.110 (drift threshold)
- φ = (1 + √5)/2 (golden ratio)

### Next Steps
1. Focus on files with simpler numerical proofs
2. Apply known working proof patterns systematically
3. Use Claude 4 for medium-difficulty proofs
4. Continue running autonomous solver until diminishing returns
5. Manual intervention for the hardest theoretical proofs

### File Structure
- Main theorem files in `NavierStokesLedger/`
- Solver scripts in `Solver/`
- Backups in `backups/` with timestamps
- Logs of all runs preserved

The project is approximately 20% complete based on remaining sorries, but the infrastructure for automated proof completion is fully operational and has demonstrated success with Claude 4 Sonnet.
