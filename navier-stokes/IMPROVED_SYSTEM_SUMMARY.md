# Improved Proof System Summary

## What We've Built

### 1. Advanced Proof System (`Solver/advanced_proof_system.py`)
- **Lean Syntax Validator**: Validates proof syntax before application
  - Checks for empty proofs, sorry statements, natural language
  - Validates tactic keywords and balanced parentheses
  - Prevents invalid proofs from corrupting files

- **Proof Extractor**: Extracts valid proofs from logs
  - Parses multiple log file formats
  - Validates each proof before extraction
  - Filters out malformed proofs

- **Claude 4 Integration**: Optimized prompting for better results
  - Clear, structured prompts with context
  - Temperature set to 0.2 for deterministic proofs
  - Specific instructions for Lean 4 tactics

- **Safe Application**: Incremental testing approach
  - Creates timestamped backups before any changes
  - Tests syntax after each proof application
  - Rolls back on failure
  - Runs incremental builds every 10 proofs

### 2. Proof Extraction Tools
- `extract_claude4_proofs.py`: Extracts the successful Claude 4 proofs
- Maintains a JSON database of verified proofs
- Can apply proofs with proper backup and testing

### 3. Key Improvements Over Previous System

#### Better Proof Extraction
- Previous: Applied any text that looked like a proof
- Now: Validates Lean syntax before extraction
- Result: No more corrupted files with random text

#### Careful Application
- Previous: Applied all proofs at once, corrupting files
- Now: Tests each file after application, rolls back on failure
- Result: Build stays functional throughout process

#### Claude 4 Optimization
- Previous: Generic prompts that generated comments
- Now: Specific Lean 4 instructions, no explanations allowed
- Result: Valid proof terms instead of natural language

## Current Status
- Successfully applied 1 proof (covering_multiplicity)
- Reduced sorry count from 318 to 317
- Build remains functional
- Have infrastructure for safe, incremental proof completion

## How to Use

### Extract and Apply Proofs from Logs
```bash
python3 Solver/advanced_proof_system.py --extract-logs autonomous_proof_claude4.log
```

### Run Claude 4 on Specific Files
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
python3 Solver/advanced_proof_system.py \
  --target-files NavierStokesLedger/BasicDefinitions.lean \
  --proofs-per-file 5
```

### Apply Known Good Proofs
```bash
python3 Solver/extract_claude4_proofs.py --apply
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix the regex pattern in advanced_proof_system.py to handle multi-line lemmas
2. Run Claude 4 on files with simpler proofs first (numerical, definitions)
3. Build up a database of verified proofs
4. Gradually work through harder proofs with human supervision

## Lessons Learned
1. **Validation is Critical**: Never apply unvalidated proofs
2. **Incremental is Better**: Test after each change
3. **Backups Save Time**: Always backup before modifications
4. **AI Needs Constraints**: Clear, specific prompts prevent garbage output
5. **Build Must Stay Green**: A broken build blocks all progress

The system is now ready for systematic proof completion with proper safeguards in place.
