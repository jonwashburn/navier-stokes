# Navier-Stokes Recognition Science Proof

A Lean 4 formalization of the Navier-Stokes global regularity proof using the Recognition Science framework.

## Overview

This project implements a novel approach to proving global regularity for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using Recognition Science principles. The proof is based on 8 fundamental axioms and derives all physical constants from first principles with zero free parameters.

## Current Status

- **40% Complete** (8 out of 20 major components)
- **45 sorries remaining** (down from 53)
- Core mathematical framework established
- Key lemmas proven: Grönwall inequalities, energy bounds, cascade relations

## Key Components

### Proven Theorems
- ✅ Modified Grönwall Inequality
- ✅ Critical Time Scale Bounds  
- ✅ Enstrophy Production Control
- ✅ Energy-Enstrophy Cascade
- ✅ Poincaré and Hölder inequalities
- ✅ Bernstein φ-inequality
- ✅ Maximum principle

### In Progress
- Geometric depletion (Constantin-Fefferman mechanism)
- Beale-Kato-Majda criterion implementation
- Global regularity assembly

## Recognition Science Approach

The proof uses Recognition Science insights:
- Eight-beat cycles prevent vorticity cascade beyond φ⁻⁴
- Ledger balance enforces energy conservation
- Recognition time τ₀ = 7.33 fs sets critical scales
- Golden ratio φ emerges as unique scaling factor

## Mathematical Background

The proof establishes that smooth initial data with finite energy leads to global smooth solutions. Key innovations:

1. **Vorticity control**: ‖ω(t)‖∞ ≤ C₀ exp(φ⁻⁴t/τ₀)
2. **Energy cascade**: Enstrophy growth bounded by φ-scaling
3. **Recognition bounds**: Eight-beat modulation prevents blowup
