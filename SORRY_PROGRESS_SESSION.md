# Sorry Progress Session Summary

## Overview
This session focused on implementing the geometric depletion framework and working through sorries in the Navier-Stokes proof.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`NavierStokesLedger/Geometry/CrossBounds.lean`**
   - Defines cross product for 3D vectors
   - Contains 3 sorries (down from initial implementation)
   - Key lemmas: `cross_product_bound`, `C_GD_value`, `aligned_vector_difference_bound`

2. **`NavierStokesLedger/GeometricDepletionSimplified.lean`**
   - Simplified Biot-Savart kernel bounds
   - Contains 2 sorries
   - Key theorems: `biot_savart_kernel_bound_simple`, `geometric_depletion_near_field`

### Files Modified:
1. **`NavierStokesLedger/PDEOperators.lean`**
   - Fixed L2NormSquared definition (removed 1 sorry)
   - Fixed unused variable warning
   - Contains 2 remaining sorries (Schwarz's theorem)

2. **`NavierStokesLedger/BiotSavart.lean`**
   - Improved Levi-Civita antisymmetry proof structure
   - Added fin_cases approach (still has sorry)

3. **`NavierStokesLedger/SimplifiedProofs.lean`**
   - Fixed phase coherence proof structure
   - Contains 3 sorries

4. **`NavierStokesLedger/RecognitionLemmas.lean`**
   - Improved comments on geometric depletion proof
   - Updated standard calculus inequality comments

## Key Achievements:
- ✓ Established geometric depletion constant C_GD = 2*sin(π/12) ≈ 0.518
- ✓ Created framework for cross product bounds in 3D
- ✓ Simplified Biot-Savart kernel implementation
- ✓ Fixed L2NormSquared compilation issue
- ✓ All modified files compile successfully

## Sorry Count Progress:
- Initial NavierStokesLedger sorry count: 43
- Current NavierStokesLedger sorry count: ~50
- The increase is due to new framework lemmas that need proofs

## Technical Insights:
1. The geometric depletion constant C_GD = 2*sin(π/12) emerges from the maximum angle π/6 between aligned vorticity vectors
2. Cross product bounds are fundamental for Biot-Savart kernel estimates
3. Many proofs require Lagrange's identity: ‖a × b‖² = ‖a‖² ‖b‖² - ⟨a,b⟩²

## Next Steps:
1. Complete the cross product bound using Lagrange's identity
2. Prove the aligned vector difference bound using law of cosines
3. Formalize Schwarz's theorem for mixed partial derivatives
4. Fix compilation errors in other files (VorticityLemmas, RSTheorems, etc.)

## Build Status:
- `NavierStokesLedger.Geometry.CrossBounds` ✓
- `NavierStokesLedger.PDEOperators` ✓  
- `NavierStokesLedger.GeometricDepletionSimplified` ✓
- Several other files have compilation errors that need fixing
