# Progress Update - December 17, 2024

## Current Status
- **Total sorries**: 189 (down from 318 initially)
- **Progress**: 40.6% complete (129 proofs completed)
- **Build status**: âœ… Successful

## Work Completed Today
1. Fixed syntax errors in Basic.lean
2. Updated C_star value to 0.142 to match paper
3. Fixed Unicode issues in BasicDefinitions.lean
4. Added missing imports for MeasureSpace
5. Created multiple solver strategies:
   - `incremental_solver.py` - Process one file at a time
   - `smart_incremental_solver.py` - Target easy proofs first
   - `simple_proof_filler.py` - Focus on numerical proofs
   - `targeted_proof_completer.py` - Target specific files
   - `direct_sorry_filler.py` - Direct proof application

## Challenges Encountered
- Build timeouts when processing large files
- Pattern matching issues with different sorry formats
- API authentication errors initially (resolved)
- Proof generation successful but application challenging

## Next Steps
1. Focus on files with single sorries for quick wins
2. Target numerical and definitional proofs
3. Improve pattern matching for proof application
4. Continue systematic elimination of sorries

## Files with Few Sorries (Priority Targets)
- GoldenRatioSimple2.lean: 1 sorry
- BasicMinimal.lean: 1 sorry  
- BasicMinimal2.lean: 1 sorry
- BealeKatoMajda.lean: 1 sorry
- GoldenRatioSimple.lean: 1 sorry
- Axioms.lean: 2 sorries
- NumericalHelpers.lean: 2 sorries
- PrimeSumBounds.lean: 2 sorries

The project maintains a clean build and is ready for continued proof completion.
