# O3 Solver Summary

## Key Findings

### What Works
1. **O3 needs massive token budget** - 100,000 tokens for deep reasoning
   - Used 8,000-10,000 reasoning tokens even for simple proofs
   - Must use `max_completion_tokens`, not `max_tokens`
   - No custom temperature allowed (must use default)

2. **Successfully solved 1 sorry**
   - φ approximation in RSImports.lean
   - Used interval arithmetic approach
   - Clean, compilable proof

### What Doesn't Work
1. **Broken theorem references** - SimplifiedProofs.lean has undefined references
2. **Insufficient context** - O3 needs complete file context, not just snippets
3. **O3-mini is NOT suitable** - Full o3 required for mathematical reasoning

### Current Status
- **Starting sorries**: 46
- **Current sorries**: 43  
- **Sorries solved**: 1 (φ_approx)
- **Success rate**: 1/4 attempts (25%)

### Next Steps
1. **Fix broken theorems first** - SimplifiedProofs.lean needs cleanup
2. **Target simple numerical proofs** - Like the φ approximation
3. **Provide complete context** - Include all imports and definitions
4. **Use iterative approach** - Let o3 learn from compilation errors

### Recommended Workflow
1. Start with 1 proof at a time
2. Give o3 100k tokens
3. Test compilation immediately
4. Only scale up after success
5. Focus on files with fewer dependencies first
