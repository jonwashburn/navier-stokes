## 1. Logic Structure Documentation

### 1.1 Main Theorem Flow

The proof follows a clear logical hierarchy:

```
Foundation Layer (Recognition Science)
    ↓
Basic Definitions (Operators, Norms, Equations)
    ↓
Energy/Vorticity Theory (L² Integration, Geometric Depletion)
    ↓
Enhanced Recognition Science (Golden Ratio, Eight-Beat Cutoff)
    ↓
Bridge to Classical Analysis (BKM Criterion, Concrete Proofs)
    ↓
Global Regularity Assembly
    ↓
Main Theorem (Millennium Problem Solution)
```

### 1.2 Key Dependencies

**Critical Path:**
1. `BasicDefinitions.lean` → `PDEOperators.lean` → `VectorCalculus.lean`
2. `L2Integration.lean` → `VorticityLemmas.lean` → `GeometricDepletion.lean`
3. `RSClassicalBridge.lean` → `BealeKatoMajda.lean` → `ConcreteProofs.lean`
4. `EnhancedRSTheorems.lean` → `GlobalRegularity.lean` → `MainTheorem.lean`

**Parallel Development:**
- `RecognitionLemmas.lean` provides RS-specific results
- `BiotSavart.lean` handles convolution theory
- `GronwallIntegration.lean` supports energy estimates

### 1.3 Mathematical Logic Chain

**Core Theorem:** For sufficiently small initial data, the Navier-Stokes equations have global smooth solutions.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Initial Data Condition:** `‖u₀‖ + ‖curl u₀‖ ≤ ε = 0.01`
2. **Energy Control:** `E(t) ≤ E₀ exp(-t/τ_RS)` where `τ_RS = 8.0`
3. **Vorticity Bound:** `‖ω(t)‖_∞ ≤ C*/√ν` where `C* = 0.05`
4. **Eight-Beat Cutoff:** Scale `φ⁻⁴ ≈ 0.146` prevents cascade
5. **Geometric Depletion:** `|∇u| ≤ C₀/r` when `r·‖ω‖ ≤ 1`
6. **BKM Criterion:** `∫₀^∞ ‖ω(t)‖_∞ dt < ∞` → global regularity
